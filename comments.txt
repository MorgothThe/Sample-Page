Time taken to finish the HTML and CSS part:-
	HTML - 6 hours
	CSS  - 8 hours

For PHP, Ajax and Javascript. From Javascript tasks, I managed to do the first task. 
	- Implementation of the smoothscroll to the top when clicked back to top button: 
		i have set the time to reach the top for 1 second and also I am animating the html body part.
 
I am willing to learn more and I did not manage to do all the tasks because of my university schedule and exam session.
